# Objectives

Locally deploy the tutors course reader for theme changes

In this lab we will get started by pulling the tutors-course-reader repo using GitHub desktop, install the dependancies & run the reader locally. The below software is required for this:

- Node.js: required to run the reader

- GitHub Desktop: Required to download the source files

- VS Code: To edit the source (Although any of your favourite code/text editors will work)
