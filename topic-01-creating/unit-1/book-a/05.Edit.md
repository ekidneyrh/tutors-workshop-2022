# Republish a Course

Let's make some small changes to the site to demonstrate how to republish a course.

Open your `tutors-starter` folder, then navigate to `topic-1`.

Notice the topic title is denoted by a `#` followed by a space. This is Markdown syntax, and it is the title text for the `Simple Units` card. Change this to whatever you wish - either the title or the description.

If you make a change, then you will need to:

-  `compile` the course (regenerate it). The `compile` process produces a new version of the  `JSON` folder located within the `tutors-starter` folder. 
-  drag and drop the newly generated folder `JSON` folder to the Netlify drop area for your published site as in the previous step.  

Here is how to do this:

First, open a Command Prompt (or Terminal on Mac). Side by side open the folder where your course is located:

In the Command Prompt, type:

~~~
cd 
~~~

... make sure to leave a space at the end:

Now drag & drop the `tutors-starter` folder from the Finder window onto the command prompt:

This will insert the full path of the folder (see above). Press `Return or Enter` now, and then type:

 ~~~
dir
 ~~~

Your Command prompt window should look as above - you have changed into the `tutors-course` folder, and this is verified by entering the `dir` command.

To compile the course, enter the following and press return:

~~~
npx tutors-json
~~~

You should see the above after a few minutes. This is a list of the course contents. The `JSON` directory will have been updated to the latest version.

The final step is to drag and drop the newly generated folder onto the Netlify project we set up in the previous step. First, revisit the project on Netlify:

Navigate into the project:

Select `Deploys`:

You should see the drag & drop zone above. Proceed to drag and drop the `JSON` folder again. If all goes well you should see a new deployment listed:

Now revisit the published site to see if your updates have been implemented.
