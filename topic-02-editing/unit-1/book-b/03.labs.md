# Adding a talk

We are going to add a talk to Unit 1. 

Let's revisit the file structure. In Unit 1 we currently have two talks and a lab. 

The easiest way to add another talk card is to copy and paste. Right click on `talk-1` and click `Copy.`

Right click on `unit-1` and click `Paste`. This adds in another folder called `talk-1-copy`. We can rename this folder to `talk-3`.

We would then edit the markdown file and change the `.pdf` to the content we want to be displayed. This action can be used to add more labs and units also. 

Save the file and recompile it by typing `npx tutors-json` into the terminal. 

Drag and drop the newly generated JSON folder to the Netlify drop area for your published site.
